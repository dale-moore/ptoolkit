# ptoolkit

This program provides a simple Electron based interface for programmers to
remember short tips as they go about their day.  The tips are saved to the file:
   C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\ptoolbox\tips.json

To start the program enter:
   npm start

When a tip is selected it is copied to the clipboard so it can be pasted
wherever it is needed.
